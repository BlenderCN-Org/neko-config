# JSHint #

Configuration and style guide for [JSHint](http://jshint.com/).

If you don't have JSHint installed and would like to use it globally you can
install it via NPM as follows.

    $ npm install -g jshint

In case you are using it locally on a project you might want to omit the global
flag and instead include *--save-dev* to only use it in development.

## Installation ##

Include the *.jshintrc* file in your project's root directory or point your
JSHint installation to the file manually.
