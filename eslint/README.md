# ESLint #

My main style guide and linter configuration for projects using
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

If you don't have ESLint installed and would like to use it globally you can
install it via NPM as follows.

    $ npm install -g eslint

In case you are using it locally on a project you might want to omit the global
flag and instead include *--save-dev* to only use it in development.

## Installation ##

Include the *.eslintrc* file in your project's root directory or point your
ESLint installation to the file manually.
