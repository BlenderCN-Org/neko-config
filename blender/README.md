# Blender Configuration #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/nekoconfig/blob/master/blender/preview.png)

My complete Blender setup. A lot of editing and such went into this one to get
it robust and running the way I wanted it to. Might change it at some point in
the future when I have time.

## Installation ##

Replace your version directory in your application data directory of Blender.
This replaces everything including your startup file so make sure you have a
backup just in case!
