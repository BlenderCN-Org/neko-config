# Blender Configuration #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/nekoconfig/blob/master/blender/preview.png)

This is my complete Blender setup and configuration as well as the Nekoblend
theme that I have created by hand. The theme has been tested with all possible
layouts and is intended to act as a modern and mostly flat design. It additionally
avoids using bevels and outlines and instead favors clean colors and areas.

My previous skin Dark Chrome is also included in this repository for legacy
purposes.

## Installation ##

To install the themes head into your Blender user preferences and go to the
themes tab. In the bottom of the window select *install theme* and browse to
the XML file. After that should have the theme selected and ready to go.

For the startup scene and user preferences replace the equivalent files in your
Blender version directory located in the application data directory. This replaces
everything including your startup file so make sure you have a backup just in case!
