# zsh Configuration #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/nekoconfig/blob/master/zsh/preview.png)

The main zsh configuration I use on all systems I run and manage.

## Installation ##

Override your *.zshrc* file with the one in this repository. Furthermore you will have to run the *plugin.sh* script to download and install plugins required by my setup. In the configuration file itself are additional steps you should pay attention to before running as some plugins and settings require extra dependencies.
