# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

# ============================== WHAT IS THIS ? ============================== #

# This is my default setup when it comes to setting up a new server and ssh.
# A lot of these settings are further customized for the server and setup at
# hand so make sure look into what you need for your use case. I run on Arch
# Linux so some of the settings here might not be the same for you if you are
# using some other SSH service.

# Here's a quick rundown of the settings and methods I use:
# - Enforce public key authentication
# - Disable root login and lock the account
# - Plain text login attempts can lead to bans
# - 2 Factor Authentication is mandatory
# - SFTP requires the same authentication methods

# ============================= CUSTOM SETTINGS ============================== #

# - Connection options. The most important being the port. - #
Port 32641
#AddressFamily any
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
#ListenAddress ::

# - Custom host key settings. - #
#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key

# - We ignore enforcing strict policies as fail2ban will handle the most. - #
#LoginGraceTime 2m
#StrictModes yes
#MaxAuthTries 6
#MaxSessions 10

# - Log additional information such as failed logins. - #
LogLevel VERBOSE

# - Enable public key authentication. - #
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# The default is to check both .ssh/authorized_keys and .ssh/authorized_keys2
# but this is overridden so installations will only check .ssh/authorized_keys
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys

# - To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here! - #
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# - Disable logging in as root. - #
PermitRootLogin no

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will
# be allowed through the ChallengeResponseAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
# PAM authentication via ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin without-password".
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.
UsePAM yes

# - Disable key passwords. Enabling is required for 2FA. - #
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes

# - Authentication order. First use public key then ask for 2FA. - #
AuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive:pam

# - Override default of no subsystems - #
Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/ssh/sftp-server

# - Disable printing the MOTD as PAM does that. - #
PrintMotd no

# - Set default banner path. - #
Banner /etc/banner

# ======================= ADDITIONAL UNTOUCHED OPTIONS ======================= #

# - Ciphers and keying - #
# RekeyLimit default none

# - Logging - #
# SyslogFacility AUTH

# AuthorizedPrincipalsFile none
# AuthorizedKeysCommand none
# AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody

# - For this to work you'll also need host keys in /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts - #
# HostbasedAuthentication no

# - Change to yes if you don't trust ~/.ssh/known_hosts - #
# HostbasedAuthentication
# IgnoreUserKnownHosts no

# - Don't read the user's ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files - #
# IgnoreRhosts yes

# Kerberos options
# KerberosAuthentication no
# KerberosOrLocalPasswd yes
# KerberosTicketCleanup yes
# KerberosGetAFSToken no

# GSSAPI options
# GSSAPIAuthentication no
# GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

# AllowAgentForwarding yes
# AllowTcpForwarding yes
# GatewayPorts no
# X11Forwarding no
# X11DisplayOffset 10
# X11UseLocalhost yes

# PrintLastLog yes
# TCPKeepAlive yes
# UseLogin no
# PermitUserEnvironment no
# Compression delayed
# ClientAliveInterval 0
# ClientAliveCountMax 3
# UseDNS no
# PidFile /run/sshd.pid
# MaxStartups 10:30:100
