# Affinity Application Configurations #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/nekoconfig/blob/master/affinity/preview.png)

These are the workspace and settings files for my Affinity applications. Currently these include Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo. I use multiple layouts but as of this point in time Affinity applications do not have direct workspaces support. As such I have different settings for ranges of monitors and such.

## Installation ##

Navigate to your application data directory and copy the corresponding applications' files into the version directories of ones you have installed. You can simply overwrite your own settings but you might want to make a backup beforehand just in case you would like to return later.
