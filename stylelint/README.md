# stylelint Setup #

Project configuration file for
[stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint). Sets up multiple style
guide preferences used for linting of SCSS, Sass, Less and SugarSS style
sheets.

If you don't have stylelint installed and would like to use it globally you can
install it via NPM as follows.

    $ npm install -g stylelint

In case you are using it locally on a project you might want to omit the global
flag and instead include *--save-dev* to only use it in development.

## Installation ##

Copy the main file into your project's root directory or point your stylelint
setup to this specific file.
