# Base16-Shell Configuration #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/nekoconfig/blob/master/zsh/preview.png)

This is a fork of the Seti UI theme from Base16-Shell. It's modified to better
suit all my different themes and styles under the neko definition. This means
less blue tint, darker colors and more contrast but overall keeping the clear
color coding that Seti brings to the table.

## Installation ##

To install the configuration simply source the *setup.sh* file.

    $ source setup.sh

Alternatively you can copy the *base16-neko.sh* file to your base16
installation directory. You will additionally have to alias the file as
specified in the setup.
