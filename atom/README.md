# Atom Configuration #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/nekoconfig/blob/master/atom/preview.png)

This is my full Atom configuration. I use Atom as my main work application and
IDE for every programming language I know and work with on a regular basis.
This means that my setup turns Atom into a full fledged IDE with A LOT of
features and plugins.

Loading times are rather high and most people will shy away but it makes my
life much nicer in the long run. For fast editing of files I use Sublime Text 3
and as such I justify my Atom being such a beast in contrast.

## Installation ##

Drag and replace the corresponding files in your Atom configuration
directories. These settings were exported using the SyncSettings package. You
can import them using it as well. If all else fails just download the packages
manually via package control and then replace their configurations with these.
