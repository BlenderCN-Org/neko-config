HexCat is a GTK2 theme created for use with HexChat.

## Installation ##

To install the GTK theme simply copy the *etc* and *share* folder to your HexChat installation.

For the color scheme you will have to copy the contents of the *config* folder
to *%APPDATA%\HexChat* (Windows) or *~/.config/hexchat* (Unix). If you are
running the portable version you will have to copy the files to the root
HexChat folder instead.

Keep in mind for the colored nick names to take effect you will have to go into
HexChats Preferences and navigate to *Interface > Appearance*. There you will
find an option to enable colored nick names. I have also included my custom
background as can be seen in the preview. If you want to use it you can
select the background image in the same settings menu.
