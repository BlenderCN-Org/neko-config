![](https://github.com/catlinman/neko-config/blob/master/hexchat/preview.png)

HexCat is a GTK2 theme created for use with HexChat.

## Installation ##

To install the GTK theme simply copy the *etc* and *share* folder to your
HexChat installation.

For the color scheme you will have to copy the contents of the *config* folder
to *%APPDATA%\HexChat* (Windows) or *~/.config/hexchat* (Unix). If you are
running the portable version you will have to copy the files to the root
HexChat folder instead.

Another thing to note is that the font I use is *DejaVu Sans Mono 8*.
Furthermore, keep in mind for the colored nick names to take effect you will
have to go into HexChats Preferences and navigate to *Interface > Appearance*.
There you will find an option to enable colored nick names. I have also
included my custom background as can be seen in the preview. If you want to use
it you can select the background image in the same settings menu.

Additionally I have a custom coloring option for timestamps as by default they
use the same color as basic text. As can be seen in the preview I use a
predefined color code to modify the color of the timestamps. To achieve this,
go to your chat input field, paste a format such as *[%H:%M:%S]*, select the
entire text, right click and insert the color code of *01*. From there on you
can copy your selected colored text into the *Time stamp format* field.

Finally I have the *Smaller text* option set in *Interface > Channel switcher*
when using the channel switcher in tab type. In the preview image I am using
the default tree view without the small text option enabled. Both settings
are supported though.
