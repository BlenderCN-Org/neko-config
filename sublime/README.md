# Sublime Configuration #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/nekoconfig/blob/master/sublime/preview.png)

My primary Sublime configuration. I use it to edit basic text and configuration
files when I don't want to fire up Atom or an IDE for simple editing tasks.
It's also my go-to for Markdown editing and writing.

## Installation ##

Open your package directory by going to *Tools > Browse packages*. From there,
replace your the contents of the *User* directory with those from this
repository. These settings were exported using the SyncSettings package. You
can import them using it as well. If all else fails just download the packages
manually via package control and then replace their configurations with these.
