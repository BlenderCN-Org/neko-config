# Sublime Configuration #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/neko-config/blob/master/sublime/preview.png)

My primary Sublime configuration. I use it to edit basic text and configuration
files when I don't want to fire up Atom or an IDE for simple editing tasks.
It's also my go-to for Markdown editing and writing.

## Installation ##

Before doing anything else, make sure you have installed *Package Control* by
opening your command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`) and selecting *Install Pacakge
Control*. After that, to avoid too many error messages, close all open files and
then close Sublime.

Open your package directory by going to *Preferences > Browse packages*. From
there, replace your the contents of the *User* directory with those from this
repository. The next time you open up Sublime, package control should
automatically install the packages and replace their configurations with these.
