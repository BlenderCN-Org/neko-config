# Sublime Configuration #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/nekoconfig/blob/master/sublime/preview.png)

My primary Sublime configuration. I use it to edit basic text and configuration
files when I don't want to fire up Atom or an IDE for simple editing tasks.
It's also my go-to for Markdown editing and writing.

## Installation ##

Drag and replace the corresponding files in your Sublime configuration
directories. These settings were exported using the SyncSettings package. You
can import them using it as well. If all else fails just download the packages
manually via package control and then replace their configurations with these.
