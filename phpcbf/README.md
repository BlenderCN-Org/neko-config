# PHPCBF Neko Standard #

This is the main file and linter configuration I use for working with PHP
files. It's rather straightforward in what it does. Just a simple coding
standard setup.

## Installation ##

Point your phpcbf installation to the xml file or include it in your root
project directory where phpcbf is used.
